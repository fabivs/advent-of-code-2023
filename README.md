# Advent Of Code 2023
[https://adventofcode.com/2023/](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

## Project structure
Solution code is in the `lib/` directory, each module represents a day and contains both parts 1 and 2.

To evaluate solutions, run the tests with `mix test`. The tests contain the examples from each problem and the final solution.
(Note: some solutions can take a little while to evaluate because of the huge input file)
